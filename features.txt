
FEATURES.
it is built with real-time database from Firebase
it has AUTHENTIFICATION with Twitter, Facebook, Google Auth
it is built with AngularJS for binding javascript and html with a couple of nice features such as ui-router
it can report faulty translation and if it reaches a certain number the user will be banned
users can navigate individual translations attached to its paragraph using pagination
administer can delete translations or ban users right away with buttons on the webpage

SETTINGS.
It will reload everytime users save translations or admin delete translations
users can only write after logging in
due to the characteristic of database paragraphs that have more than 10 are in weird order ex) 1, 11, 12, 2, 3, ...
  and therefore the translations are also attached to the paragraphs in weird order -> user won't notice though....shit!!
